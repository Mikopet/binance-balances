# Crypto Exchange Balance Watcher
This software wants to help with getting information on actual account balances on various __Crypto Exchanges__.
There is no specific goal, it's more like to practice Rust... but you never know...

### Usage

It's very straightforward. You need a `.env` file in the working dir:
TODO: reorganize to toml
```sh
BINANCE_API_KEY=<api key here>
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=<secret key here>
```

And just run it:
```bash
$ cargo run
```
